The king's voice was choked with anger.  "You are a worse pirate than Salladhor Saan."
Theon Greyjoy opened his eyes.  His shoulders were on fire and he could not move his hands.  For half a heartbeat
he feared he was back in his old cell under the Dreadfort, that the jumble of memories inside his head was no more than
the residue of some fever dream. I was asleep, he realized.  That, or passed out from the pain.  When he tried to move,
he swung from side to side, his back scraping against stone.  He was hanging from a wall inside a tower, his wrists
chained to a pair of rusted iron rings.
The air reeked of burning peat.  The floor was hard-packed dirt.  Wooden steps spiraled up inside the walls to the roof.
He saw no windows.  The tower was dank, dark, and comfortless, its only furnishings a high-backed chair and a scarred
table resting on three trestles.  No privy was in evidence, though Theon saw a champerpot in one shadowed alcove.
The only light came from the candles on the table.  His feet dangled six feet off the floor.
